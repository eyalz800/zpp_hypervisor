     * appealed to is absent on the platform that matters most.

     * only, and that is what puts `zpp_ap_start_up_main`'s address where
     * a starting processor will find it. Both therefore come alive
     * strictly after construction returned.
     *
     * What would break it is a fourth caller reachable before `main` has
     * armed those two. That is the thing to check when adding one, and
